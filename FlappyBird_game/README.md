# FLAPPY BIRD GAME

## INTRODUCTION

Welcome to my version of the **Flappy Bird** game! 

After three months of studying Python, I created this project using the Pygame library. This game is a fun and interactive way to showcase the programming skills I've developed, including game mechanics, physics, and user interaction.

## How to Play
- Press the **Spacebar** to make the bird flap its wings and avoid hitting the pipes.
- The objective is to keep the bird flying as long as possible without hitting the ground or the pipes.
- Each successful pipe pass earns you a point.

## Features
- **Simple Controls**: Control the bird with the spacebar.
- **Random Pipe Generation**: Pipes are randomly positioned to increase difficulty.
- **Scoring System**: The game keeps track of your score based on how many pipes you successfully pass.
- **Collision Detection**: The bird will collide with pipes and the ground, leading to a game over.
